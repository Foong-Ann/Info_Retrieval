As a part of a project for MIE250: Fundamentals of Object-oriented Programming (Java), I built an in-memory information retrieval system using a HashMap-based inverted index. The search results were ranked using the TF-IDF (term frequency- inverse document frequency) scoring rule. 

A zip file of NSF research grant abstracts from the early 1990â€™s was provided in the form of .txt files to test the code on a fairly large corpus of documents.
